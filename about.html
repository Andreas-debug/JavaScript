                    Initially, we began working together on maths (trigonometry), before we graduated to programming. 
                    <br>
                    It's a student (Andreas), teacher (Stuart) and master (<a class="Edward" target="_blank" href="https://www.edwindiaz.com">Edwin Diaz</a>) team. 
                    <br>
                    Our mission is to create a unique website which is hand-built by us (S&amp;A).
                    <br>
                    The website's goal is to convert images to ASCII-code, depending on the brightness of the pixels.
                    <br><br>
                    A last thank you to Tobias, who helped us out a lot with the JavaScripting of the converter, and the wonderful companies <a href="https://www.nuiteq.com/">NUITEQ&reg;</a> <br>who provided us with some time surrounded by experts who were willing to answer our questions and help us out, <br>and <a href="https://www.wpopt.net/">WPopt</a> who were nice enough to provide us with a free domain!
